Nicco Report:

Issues:

- Unhandled Exception stating access violation when I'm using a dual setup. This might be specific to my system so tell me what you guys have.
Or, it could be related to GLFW's viewport handling since that currently isn't being accounted for in the program.

- Currently not handling frame limiting calculations correctly. FPS on my system stuck on 33fps but nothing is running.

- In Timer.cpp the current glfw method is glfw.GetTime(), but there is a .GetTimerValue() and grabs more hi-res values.

- Currently more interested in how to link Vulkan against GLFW so I'm kind of doing minimal stuff for the Genjine framework.
